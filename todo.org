* Comp-II feedback
** Look into computational linguistics / psycholinguistics literature
** What kind of language acquisition is this model doing?
*** How can we communicate this work to linguists?
*** Is this similar to second language acquisition?
*** Is this similar to relearning speech after a stroke?
** How best to teach the system explicitly?
** How much is this a statistical problem versus a control problem?
** What is the CS contribution?
*** Mostly in the implementation?
** Idea: train the model in one language, test it in another
** Use a richer set of words; i.e., some with vowel reuse (spanish digits?)
* Post Comp-II
** Make an IPython notebook to play around with eqs in Zilany, 2006
** Read Guenther, 1995
** Read Howard & Messum, 2011
** Replicate results in Fiete & Seung, 2007
