** Outline of Comp-II
*** Question 1: Can current vocal tract models actually give good speech?
*** Answer 1: Use modern optimal motor control to generate a target sound.
*** Question 2: Can this be done in a biologically plausible manner?
*** Answer 2: Do learning in NEF.
*** Question 3: Can speech recognition be done better on cochlear signals?
*** Answer 3: Do a subset of speech recognition with cochlear signals.
*** Question 4: Can that subset be done in a biologically plausible manner?
*** Answer 4: Do subset in NEF.
*** Question 5: Can we hook up the synthesis to the recognition?
*** Answer 5: Produce sounds, optimize the recognition.
*** Question 6: In neurons?
*** Answer 6: Do in neurons.
